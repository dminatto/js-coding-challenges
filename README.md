# JavaScript Coding Challenges

This repository contains solutions to five common programming challenges implemented in JavaScript. Each solution is organized in its own directory with detailed documentation and examples.

## 🚀 Challenges

1. **Sum Calculation**

   - Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to K while K is less than INDEX
   - Located in: `/src/challenge1-sum`

2. **Fibonacci Sequence**

   - Verifies if a given number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence
   - Located in: `/src/challenge2-fibonacci`

3. **Billing Analysis**

   - Analyzes daily billing data to find minimum, maximum, and above-average days
   - Located in: `/src/challenge3-billing-analysis`

4. **State Percentage Calculator**

   - Calculates the percentage representation of each state's billing in total revenue
   - Located in: `/src/challenge4-state-percentage`

5. **String Reversal**
   - Reverses a string without using built-in reverse functions
   - Located in: `/src/challenge5-string-reverse`

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/js-coding-challenges.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd js-coding-challenges

npm install
```

## 📖 Usage

Each challenge can be run independently or in a interactive menu

```bash
# Run individual challenges
npm run challenge1
npm run challenge2
npm run challenge3
npm run challenge4
npm run challenge5

# Run all challenges sequentially
npm run all-challenges

# Run the interactive menu
npm start
```

## 📝 Challenge Details

### Challenge 1: Sum Calculation

Calculates the sum of a sequence based on an index value.

### Challenge 2: Fibonacci Sequence

Determines if a number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence.

### Challenge 3: Billing Analysis

Analyzes billing data to find:

Minimum daily billing
Maximum daily billing
Number of days above monthly average

### Challenge 4: State Percentage

Calculates percentage distribution of billing across different states.

### Challenge 5: String Reversal

Implements string reversal without using built-in reverse functions.
